# Rockstardevelopers shopping experience

## Task

Create a Single Page Application for a shopping experience.

The app should fetch at least 9 products from https://fakestoreapi.com/.

The app should show these products in a grid or list view (see layout-1.pdf and layout-2.pdf).

The layouts are just an inspiration, please feel free to create your design as you think it's best.

If you click on one of the products, it should be added to the shopping cart and the hit count should increase.

It should be possible to see the content of the shopping cart by clicking on the shopping cart icon.

A single item can be removed from the shopping cart. 

## Requirements

- Create a SPA with a framework of your choice (Angular, React, Vue, ...).
- Use a version management (GitHub, Bitbucket) through which you make the project available to us.
